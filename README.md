# Setup

1. clone this repository
2. `npm install` or `yarn install` this folder
3. `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the dev server
4. `open http://localhost:4517` to see what the default route renders

If you're using VSCode open the workspace.

To use JS instead of TypeScript rename src/index.ts to index.js

You will have to restart server after making changes to see them appear.
